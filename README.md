**Introduction:**
The #8WeekSQLChallenge is a popular initiative designed to help participants improve their SQL skills through a series of progressively challenging problems. Created by Danny Ma and hosted on his website, Data With Danny, this challenge provides a hands-on approach to learning SQL by working on case studies that mimic real-world business problems.

I am excited to take up this challenge and enhance my SQL skills by solving these case studies. Each case study is a unique opportunity to apply various SQL concepts and techniques to extract insights and answer important business questions.
